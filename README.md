performed machine learning on a housing data to predict the prices of a house from given features.
applied three different models Decision tree , linear regression and random forest among which random forest gave the output. 
I first checked the correlation of the data with respect to the median value and found that median value had a very positive correlation with RM(rooms per dwelling).
After this i applied pipeling to tranform my dataset and then applied it to different models.
